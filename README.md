# imageprocessing
The "Open" button directs users to open a directory. The program automates to search .bmp file under selected directory.
The program will display the size of the picture on the left upper conner after loading the .bmp picture.
The user can click the "next" button to continue to process the image. The first result shows the color distribution of red, green and blue channel in a chart presentation.
The second result shows a 1.5 times brighter image of the original image. The third result shows a monochrome images of the original images. The last result shows the dithered grey scale image by using the Bayer filtering algorithm. The algorithm uses Bayer Matrix of 8 * 8 size. Using the 4*4 matrix instead of 8 * 8 can get the best quality image. It can divide the 256 colorscale by 16 (4*4) to get 16 blocks (256/16=16). Explanation: For each blocks, the program compares a block of image with sample matrix. If this block is larger than the sample matrix, it can print dot. It can also generate a extremly low image by using 2 * 2 matrix.
